Hi. My name is Darshan Krishnaswamy. I’m a junior at Mass Academy. I live in Chelmsford, which is located just south of Lowell, and I attended Chelmsford High School from first grade until tenth grade. I have an older brother named Ashwin, who is currently a junior at Purdue University majoring in Data Science.
At Chelmsford High School, I was part of my school’s math team, science team, cs team, and speech and debate team. In math team, I competed in many local competitions in the Greater Boston Math League along with larger competitions such as the AMC 10/12 and AIME. In science team, I competed in local and state competitions as part of the West Suburban Science League and the state Science Olympiad. I also competed in some other local events such as the Blue Lobster Bowl, an oceanography competition at MIT. In the CS team, I participated in a few hackathons. In Speech and Debate Team, I did public forum debate for two years and competed in a bunch of competitions, including the international competition at Harvard.
Outside of school, my main hobbies are tennis and computer science. I was on my school’s junior varsity tennis team for the last two years. Although I am not great at playing tennis, I still find it enjoyable, especially when I’m bored and it’s nice outside. For cs, I enjoy making Android applications and have been developing them since eighth grade (and am still learning a lot as I continue creating them).
