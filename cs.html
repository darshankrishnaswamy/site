<p class="text">Computer Science at Mass Academy is taught by Mrs. Taricco. In Computer Science, we started learning how to use HTML5 and CSS3 for web development.
    We used both languages (along with Javascript, which was optional) to create our own websites from scratch.</p>
<p class="text">Our class is mainly a Java class where we learn how to use the Java programming language (and it also covers the topics of AP Computer Science).
I had already learned Java before coming to the school, so I have been working on a Computer Science project with Alex Sun. Our project is a neural network
that predicts the stock market. It takes in a stock company and a date, and it searches the internet for articles about the company; it then "reads" those articles
and predicts whether the stock value will increase or decrease in the near future. A link to the source code for the project can be found <a target="blank" href="https://github.com/technoal/stockexchangeneuralnetworkinferencedevice">here</a></p>

    <p class="text">Before starting to work on our Computer Science Projects, we were given some challenge problems from Project Euler that we had to try to code solutions
    for. Below is my code for problem number 8, which involved examining a very large number (with 1000 digits) and trying to find the highest product of 13 adjacent digits
    in the number.</p>
