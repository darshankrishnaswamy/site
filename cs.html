<p class="text">Computer Science at Mass Academy is taught by Mrs. Taricco. In Computer Science, we started learning how to use HTML5 and CSS3 for web development.
    We used both languages (along with Javascript, which was optional) to create our own websites from scratch.</p>
<p class="text">Our class is mainly a Java class where we learn how to use the Java programming language (and it also covers the topics of AP Computer Science).
I had already learned Java before coming to the academy, so I was able to work on an independent Computer Science project with Alex Sun instead. Our project is a neural network
that predicts the stock market. It takes in a stock company and a date, and it searches the internet for articles about the company; it then "reads" those articles
and predicts whether the stock value will increase or decrease in the near future. We used a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to create our
    neural network.
    A link to the source code for the project can be found <a target="blank" href="https://github.com/technoal/stockexchangeneuralnetworkinferencedevice">here</a>.</p>

    During D Term, we worked on our Apps For Good projects, where we developed mobile or web applications to solve a problem or help out the community.
    I worked in a group with Daanish Qureshi and Shriyaa Chittibabu, and we developed an Android application called CommUnity. The app connects users who need
    assistance with a certain task with other users who are able to conveniently help out with that task. For example, if someone who is unable to go to the grocery
    store needs some items, they can get connected with someone who is already planning on going to the grocery store, and they would be able to pick up the person's
    groceries without much inconvenience.
