<p class="bodytext">Hi, I’m Darshan Krishnaswamy, a junior at Mass Academy. I'm from Chelmsford, MA, which is located just south of Lowell.
    I attended Chelmsford High School from first grade through tenth grade. I have an older brother named Ashwin. He is currently a junior at Purdue University, majoring in
Data Science. On the right is a picture of myself with presidential candidate Andrew Yang.</p>

    <p class="bodytext">At Chelmsford High School, I was part of my school’s math team, science team, speech and debate team, and DECA.
        In math team, I competed in many local competitions in the Greater Boston Math League along with larger competitions such as the AMC 10/12 and AIME.
        I also competed in Eastern Mass ARML and attended the competition at Penn State. In science team, I competed in local and state competitions as part of the
        West Suburban Science League and the state Science Olympiad, along with some other local events such as the Blue Lobster Bowl, an oceanography competition at
        MIT. For DECA, I competed in the Personal Financial Literacy event and qualified for the state competition. In Speech and Debate Team, I did public forum debate
        for two years and competed in a bunch of competitions, including the international competition at Harvard. You can click on the image on the right to learn more about Chelmsford High School.</p>

    <p class="bodytext">Outside of school, my main hobbies are tennis and computer science. I was on my school’s junior varsity tennis team for the last two years. I really enjoy playing tennis,
    especially on days when the weather is perfect and I have nothing else to do. Outside of the school team, I sometimes go to the courts with my brother or my friends and just play
    for fun. For computer science, I enjoy developing Android applications. I was first introduced to app development in the eighth grade, and I still continue to learn each time I
    develop a new app. i am also currently learning how to use Kotlin, a new language which is similar to java, but is written more concisely and is easier to use. Over the summer, I learned
    how to develop machine learning projects and train neural networks using python, and I hope to do some machine learning projects soon.</p>

    <p class="bodytext">
        Another major hobby of mine is robotics. I was part of a First Robotics Competition (FRC) team called Stormgears in my freshman and sophomore years.
        In FRC, we build 120 pound robots that have to compete in a certain challenge. Last year’s challenge was called "Deep Space." The challenge was to build a robot
        that could pick up discs and balls and place them in different areas on the field to earn point.. My team won the Chairman's Award (the most prestigious
        FRC award) last year and qualified for the FIRST World Championship in Detroit. The team also qualified for the World Championship in my freshman year, and at the competition,
        our alliance got first place in our division and we qualified for the Einstein Field, which includes the top 24 teams in the entire competition. This year, I am looking forward to joining Mass
        Academy's FRC team, Gompei and the H.E.R.D.

    <p class="bodytext">
        At Mass Academy, so far, I have joined the CAD (computer aided design) club, math team, actuarial math club, and the disc golf team. In CAD, we have used SolidWorks for 3D modeling.
        So far, we have created our own key fobs, stamps, and we are currently working on creating ramps for use in physics classroom demonstrations in nearby schools.
        <p class="bodytext">In math team, the main competition that we compete in is WOCOMAL, or Worcester County Math League. We also compete in a few other competitions such as "Who Wants to be a Mathematician", the WPI Math
        Meet, and MAML (Massachusetts Association of Mathematics Leagues). </p>
        <p class="bodytext">Actuarial math focuses on math problems that deal with money and interest rates. The questions involve calculating the value
        of money over time, while accounting for factors such as interest rates and new deposits. There are also questions involving insurance which depend on the probability that a person will be alive
            at the end of a given period of time, which makes the questions much more interesting.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">Disc golf is similar to normal golf, except that instead of hitting a golf ball with a club, we throw
        frisbees and try to get them into baskets.
