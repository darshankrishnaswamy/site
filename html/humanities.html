<h2>In Humanities, over the summer, we read Walden by Thoreau. We wrote and performed our own skits based on the book in front of the whole class.</h2>
<h2>Now, we are reading "August 2026: There Will Come Soft Rains" and "The Pedestrian" by Ray Bradbury. They both depict a dystopian society in which
    technology both literally and figuratively destroys humanity.</h2>
