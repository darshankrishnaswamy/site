<h2 class="centerinparent">Math modeling is taught by Mr. Regele. In the class, we are currently working on a problem relating to
    <a href="http://https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faro_shuffle">Perfect shuffles</a>, which "involves splitting the deck into two
    equal halves of 26 cards and then interweaving them perfectly so that the cards from each packet alternate, coming together like a zipper." We are working on
    figuring out a formula to determine how many perfect shuffles it will take for a certain set of cards to return to its original state.</h2>
<h2>We are also learning how to use the Math Modeling program <a href="https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/">Mathematica</a>, which we will use
    for future math problems and competitions.</h2>
