    Math Modeling
</div>
<div class="divtext text">
<p class="text">Math Modeling is taught by Mr. Regele. In the class, we learn about many different topics, including perfect shuffles, mods, different number bases, and vectors.</p>
<p class="text">We are also learning how to use the Math Modeling program <a href="https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/" target="_blank">Wolfram Mathematica</a>, which we used for the HiMCM Competition.
HiMCM is the High School Mathematical Competition in Modeling, a competition where we have to work in groups of 4 to create a model to represent a certain
    problem. My team included myself, Alex Sun, William Hung, and Akhi Yarlagadda. The problem that we answered had to do with the increasing popularity of "free" electricity in restaurants and other public areas, and
    we had to model its popularity and costs, as well as how to minimize these costs. We chose this problem because it seemed interesting to
    solve a problem where we had to search the internet for real data about the topic, and then analyze this data to create a prediction about the future. We used data
    from the US Government about national energy consumption. We then created models to represent future US energy consumption, which we used to predict how the total amount
    of "free" electricity consumption will change in the future, and what its impacts would be.
    Below is our final paper, which contains our solution, a summary, and an "article" for a school newspaper (which was part of the original HiMCM problem).

    <p class="text">We also use Mathematica for in-class Math Modeling assignments. Below is an example of a modeling assignment we had, where
        we had to create different types of regression lines to model data about radioactive waste. We created least-squares regression lines, two-point fit lines, and
        median-median lines. We also had to plot and compare the residual values for each fit line.
