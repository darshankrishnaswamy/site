<p class="text">Physics at Mass Academy is taught by Mr. Ellis. So far, we have learned both 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional kinematics (the study of objects in motion), Forces, Work and Energy, and Rotational Motion concepts.
    </p>
<p class="text">We sometimes get a single advanced problem, called an Über Problem. These problems have multiple parts and we get about a week to solve the problems and
    do a full write-up. They are very similar to lab write-ups, but we don't do the experiments ourselves.
</p>
    <p class="text"> Below is an Über problem that I did in October, where I had to find the coefficient of friction between a block and a surface.  </p>

    <p class="text">Here is another Uber Rocket Problem that I did in September, where I had to find the total time that a rocket was in the air.</p>
