<p class="text">Physics at Mass Academy is taught by Mr. Ellis. So far, we have learned both 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional kinematics (the study of objects
    in motion), Forces, Work and Energy, Rotational Motion, and Rotational Dynamics.
    </p>

<p class="text">We sometimes get a single advanced problem, called an Über problem. These problems have multiple parts and we get about a week to solve the problems and
    do a full write-up. They are very similar to lab write-ups, but we don't do the experiments ourselves.
</p>
    <p class="text"> Below is an Über problem that I did in October, where I was given a jumper sitting on an elevated surface, attached with a chain to a barrel of rocks.
    The task was to find the coefficient of friction between the jumper and the floor based on how far the jumper ended up from its starting point.</p>

    <p class="text">Here is another Über problem that I did in September. The question was about a model rocket which was launched vertically upward, and after it fell
    a certain distance from its maximum height, a parachute opened and the rocket approached a terminal velocity. The task was to find the total time that the rocket
    spent in the air based on this information.</p>
