<p class="text">Spanish at Mass Academy is taught by Mrs. Wildfong. Spanish class is a full immersion class, meaning that we are not allowed to speak any english in class.
    We do many different things in the class to learn spanish. We often work on small assignments in pairs or groups (speaking in spanish, of course). We also
    watch videos, movies, and TV shows in spanish. </p>
 <p class="text">Every day, we have to encounter five new words, look up their definitions, and describe them in spanish. I found this to be a
very helpful way to learn new words because all the words I learn are relevant to what I am working on in class or at home.</p>
    <p>Early on in the year, we learned about writing in the imperfect past tense (writing about repeated action that occurred in the past) and the preterite
    past tense (writing about things that happened one time in the past). Below is a description of an event that happened during my childhood (a vacation to Europe).</p>

    <p class="text">Another assignment that we had was to create a meme about something related to the school. Below is a meme I created about how students
    at the school often accidentally "reply all" to emails sent to the entire grade, so we all end up getting a copy of the replies.</p>
