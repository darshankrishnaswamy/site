<p class="bodytext">Hi, I’m Darshan Krishnaswamy, a junior at Mass Academy. I'm from Chelmsford, MA, which is located just south of Lowell.
    I attended Chelmsford High School from first grade through tenth grade. I have an older brother named Ashwin, who is currently a junior at Purdue University
    majoring in Data Science. You can click on the image below to learn more about Chelmsford High School</p>

    <p class="bodytext">At Chelmsford High School, I was part of my school’s math team, science team, speech and debate team, and DECA.
        In math team, I competed in many local competitions in the Greater Boston Math League along with larger competitions such as the AMC 10/12 and AIME.
        I also competed in Eastern Mass ARML and attended the competition at Penn State. In science team, I competed in local and state competitions as part of the
        West Suburban Science League and the state Science Olympiad, along with some other local events such as the Blue Lobster Bowl, an oceanography competition at
        MIT. For DECA, I competed in the Personal Financial Literacy event and qualified for the state competition. In Speech and Debate Team, I did public forum debate
        for two years and competed in a bunch of competitions, including the international competition at Harvard. </p>

    <p class="bodytext">Outside of school, my main hobbies are tennis and computer science. I was on my school’s junior varsity tennis team for the last two years. Although I
        am not great at playing tennis, I still find it enjoyable, especially when I’m bored and it’s nice outside. For cs, I enjoy making Android applications and have been developing
        them since eighth grade (and am still learning a lot as I continue creating them). </p>
