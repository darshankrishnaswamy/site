<p class="text">STEM at Mass Academy is taught by Dr. Crowthers. In STEM, we are learning how to make a science project to compete in the local science fair. We have learned
    about the engineering design process
    and how to effectively brainstorm ideas. We also learn how to develop strategies for troubleshooting when things go wrong with out projects.</p>
    <p class="text">My STEM Project is a set of neural networks that help visually-impaired pedestrians know when it is safe to cross the street. It currently
        uses convolutional neural networks to classify images as containing either red pedestrian traffic lights or green pedestrian traffic lights. I am currently
        working on setting up object detection so that it is able to locate the traffic light in the image, which will help to increase the accuracy of the neural network.

        When we were first developing our ideas for our STEM projects, we had to create a document called the "Project Brief," which contained a description of the project,
the overall goal of the project, background for the project, and a projected timeline for the project. My project brief can be found below.

    <p class="text">In December, we had a preliminary STEM Fair event, where we presented the work/data that we had built/acquired
        at the time. We presented our work on poster boards, and discussed our work with numerous judges. An image of my STEM poster board can be found below.
