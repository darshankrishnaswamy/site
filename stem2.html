        After STEM 1 has been completed, we start working on our STEM 2 projects. In STEM 2, we work in small groups on assistive technology projects. We mainly
        work with clients from organizations such as <a href="https://www.sevenhills.org/" target="_blank">Seven Hills</a> and
        <a href="https://www.easterseals.com/" target="_blank"> EasterSeals</a> and develop devices to assist individuals in need from these organizations.</p>

</p>
    <p class="text">
        My STEM 2 group consisted of myself, Maxi Attiogbe, and Ryan Dillon. Our project was to create an assistive device for an individual with dysphagia, which means
    that they have difficulty swallowing their food. As a result, they must take longer to finish eating, and their food often gets cold while they are eating.
    We were asked to develop a plate warmer which could be used to keep the client's food warm for at least one hour while they are eating in order to enable them
    to enjoy a warm meal.

    <p class="text" style="text-align: center; font-size: 30px">Approach
    </p>
    <p class="text">
        We initially had many different ideas about how to go
        about developing the plate warmer, but we eventually narrowed it down to 3 options. The first option using heating coils within the plate to heat it up.
        Our second idea was to use hot water beneath the surface of the plate to heat the surface by convection.
        Our third option was to use a surface a the top that could be removed, heated,
        and reattached, which would heat the food directly by conduction.
        After a conversation with our client about their specific needs and requirements for the plate warmer,
        we decided to continue forward with idea 2, using hot water to heat the plate by convection.
