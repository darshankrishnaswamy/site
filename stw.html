    <p class="text">STW at Mass Academy is taught by Dr. Crowthers. STW stands for Science and Technical Writing. In STW, we learn how to write science papers. We mainly focus
    on using proper grammar and style for a formal science paper or article. We spend a lot of time reading research papers and science articles related to our STEM topics, analyzing them,
    and taking notes on them to use for our projects. </p>
    <p class="text">One important assignment that we had throughout B Term was the Literature Review. For the Literature Review, we had to read through multiple
    science journal articles related to our STEM projects and write an article summarizing those sources and how they relate to our STEM projects. Below is my Literature
    Review, focusing on the topics of machine learning and pedestrian traffic lighs.</p>

    <p class="text">During our STEM Projects, we deal a lot with different types of data. Because of this, we have to learn how to analyze this data using different
    statistical tests. One assignment we had was to create a presentation and an infographic about one type of statistical test. Maxi Attiogbe, Daanish Qureshi, and I did a
    presentation about the chi-square test, which can be found below.</p>
